The following is my personal cry for digital freedom, and neurodiversity acceptance. The following highlights my belief in open technology, the rejection of copyright laws, and the right of autistic individuals to live undisturbed and in peace.

 I believe that every person has the right to use, modify, and distribute software without fear of legal consequences. I reject the idea that proprietary software is essential for progress and innovation.

I advocate for the elimination of copyright laws and the development of a truly open and accessible technology environment. I believe that sharing knowledge and resources is crucial for the betterment of all people.

I stand for internet freedom and privacy for all individuals. I believe that access to the internet is a fundamental human right and that everyone should have the ability to communicate and share information freely and securely.

As an individual on the autism spectrum, I understand the unique challenges faced by my community. I advocate for the creation of inclusive and accessible technology, as well as support for the diverse needs and abilities of autistic individuals. This includes the freedom to live a life without the need for social or physical contact with others, if that is what an individual prefers. This means respect for individuals that have a high need of solitude and might not feel comfortable in social situations.

Furthermore, I believe that understanding and acceptance of neurodiversity should be promoted, and the society should be educated to understand and respect the way of life of autistic individuals, as well as other neurodiverse individuals. This includes the right to live and work in environments that are tailored to their needs, including accommodations for sensory sensitivities, and the right to live in a society that is free from discrimination based on neurodiversity.

I call on all individuals to join me in fighting for a free and open technology landscape that benefits everyone. Together, we can create a world where technology serves the people, rather than the other way around, and a society where neurodiversity is respected, understood, and embraced.
