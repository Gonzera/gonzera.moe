Hello, I’m Gonzera — a backend enjoyer, Linux ricer, and fan of writing rants about software and the internet.

This site is my digital hideout. I don’t care about SEO, I don’t want followers, and I’m not selling you anything. I just want a place to write, post weird stuff,and pretend it’s still 2003.

▸ Languages I like: Rust, C++, C#, Bash
▸ Tools that I fw: Neovim, tmux, Hugo
▸ Current obsession: building useless software and blogging about them
▸ Location: somewhere between neovim and /dev/null

Want to reach me? Too bad.
