          I believe that every person has the right to use, modify, and
          distribute software without fear of legal consequences. I reject the
          idea that proprietary software is essential for progress and
          innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I advocate for the elimination of copyright laws and the development
          of a truly open and accessible technology environment. I believe that
          sharing knowledge and resources is crucial for the betterment of all
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stand for internet freedom and privacy for all individuals. I
          believe that access to the internet is a fundamental human right and
          that everyone should have the ability to communicate and share
          information freely and securely.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an individual on the autism spectrum, I understand the unique
          challenges faced by my community. I advocate for the creation of
          inclusive and accessible technology, as well as support for the
          diverse needs and abilities of autistic individuals. This includes the
          freedom to live a life without the need for social or physical contact
          with others, if that is what an individual prefers. This means respect
          for individuals that have a high need of solitude and might not feel
          comfortable in social situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I believe that understanding and acceptance of
          neurodiversity should be promoted, and the society should be educated
          to understand and respect the way of life of autistic individuals, as
          well as other neurodiverse individuals. This includes the right to
          live and work in environments that are tailored to their needs,
          including accommodations for sensory sensitivities, and the right to
          live in a society that is free from discrimination based on
          neurodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I call on all individuals to join me in fighting for a free and open
          technology landscape that benefits everyone. Together, we can create a
          world where technology serves the people, rather than the other way
          around, and a society where neurodiversity is respected, understood,
          and embraced.
