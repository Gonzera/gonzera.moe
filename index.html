            So, you are probably asking yourself what is this website. After some time thinking about it i just decided to say "fuck it", and build a personal website for myself. Even trough i have pretty much zero social media presence and no one actually knows me, i started to think it would be cool to become a internet landlord. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 3%;">
            This actually looks pretty bad and will stay this way probably since i have no interest in learning more css, and a refuse to implement JS (even trough i think it could look pretty cool) in such website. So yeah, i will be sticking with this extremely low effort early 2000's look for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will probably be adding some software/media related rants in the future. It will be cool to be able to publish stuff on my own little space, without having to worry about breaking X social media guidelines.
